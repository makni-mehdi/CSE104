        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            Trobbles are cute egg-shaped digital pets that simulate real pets. <br>
            One has to “feed” them regularly, clean up behind them, and generally take care of their well-being.<br>
            One starts with only one trobble, at each round, each trobble present in the game is subject to the following actions:<br>
            - Their hunger increses by a certain amount.<br>
            - Their health decreases proportionally to their hunger.<br>
            Once one trobble's health hits 0, he dies. YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE THAT HAPPEN for such a CUTE creature.<br>
            During the game, one gets feedback on each trobble's health but not the exact index of health to keep the game more challenging.<br>
            Note that there is a trade-off between health and hunger.<br>

            Don't let the Trobble go through trouble!
